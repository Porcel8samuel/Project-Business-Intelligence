# Business Intelligence Project - Global Impacts of COVID-19

This project aims to analyze the global impacts of COVID-19 using Business Intelligence tools, focusing on the pandemic's evolution, its consequences, and its relationship with investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using a collection of globally sourced data, interactive dashboards and a detailed report were created to visually present the findings.

## TOOLS USED
**Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and data visualization.
**CSV**: Format used to store global COVID-19 data.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE
This repository is organized into three main folders:

**Data**
Contains 11 CSV files with relevant information about the COVID-19 pandemic globally, such as confirmed cases, deaths, recovery rates, and more. These datasets form the foundation for the analyses presented in the dashboards.

**Dashboard**
Contains the Power BI file with interactive dashboards created from the data. These dashboards display key metrics, such as the pandemic's temporal evolution, mortality rates, country comparisons, and other indicators essential for understanding the global impact of COVID-19.

**Docs**
Contains important documents related to the project:

- **Report**: A detailed document explaining the findings and analyses performed in the project. The report is structured as follows:
  1. INTRODUCTION
  2. COVID-19 EVOLUTION
  3. COVID-19 CONSEQUENCES
  4. EVOLUTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)
  5. INVESTMENT IN AI AND ITS CONSEQUENCES
  6. CONCLUSIONS
    
- **Technical File**: A technical description detailing the steps followed for creating the dashboards and processing the data. It also includes information about the data sources and methodologies used.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The project aims to analyze the global impacts of COVID-19, focusing specifically on its evolution, the pandemic's consequences, and its relationship with AI investments. Through data visualization in Power BI, the project identifies key patterns and supports informed decision-making regarding pandemic management and AI development. Additionally, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 and the role AI has played in the global response to the crisis.

This project demonstrates how to use Business Intelligence tools to analyze large volumes of data and visually present results interactively.
